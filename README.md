# Automated-cardiothoraric-ratio-calculation-and-cardiomegaly-using-deep-learning-approach-
By using deep learning use the methods for calculating the cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and detecting cardiomegaly,
a proposed solution introduces an automated system that utilizes a deep learning approach. The system aims to
automate the process of CTR calculation and cardiomegaly detection, addressing the challenges associated with
manual methods. By employing advanced algorithms based on deep learning techniques, the system can analyze
medical images and accurately determine the CTR, which is a critical measure in diagnosing cardiomegaly. The
proposed system not only streamlines the calculation process but also enhances the accuracy and efficiency of
cardiomegaly detection, enabling healthcare professionals to make quicker and more informed decisions.
Ultimately, this automated approach has the potential to significantly improve patient care by reducing time and
effort while ensuring accurate assessments of cardiothoracic abnormalities.
